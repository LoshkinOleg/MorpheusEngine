# LLM Todo (Current)

## Active priorities

- [ ] Implement `lore_retriever` module scaffold and include it in debug traces.
- [ ] Add richer deterministic invariant/policy checks (post-arbiter).
- [ ] Improve debug UX for model conversations (collapsible attempts and copy actions).
- [ ] Add contract tests for `ActionCandidates` and `LoremasterOutput` evolution safety.
- [ ] Add endpoint tests for clarification-branch behavior.
